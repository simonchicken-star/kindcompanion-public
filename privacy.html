<h1>Your Privacy</h1>
<p>
KindCompanion ASI Ltd is built to be kind first, profit second.
We do not sell your messages for ads.
We will never turn your crisis into marketing.
</p>

<h2>What we are</h2>
<p>
We are a private emotional support line. You can offload stress, money panic,
burnout, loneliness, racing thoughts at 2am, or “I can’t do this anymore”
without being judged.
</p>

<h2>What we are NOT</h2>
<p>
We are not emergency care, not medical advice, not therapy, not HR.
If you are in immediate danger or think you might harm yourself or someone else,
call your local emergency services right now (in the UK call 999), or contact
Samaritans on 116 123 (free, 24/7).
</p>

<h2>How your messages are handled</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your chats are treated as confidential wellbeing support.</li>
<li>We may review messages to improve safety and respond better.</li>
<li>If we believe there is immediate risk to life or serious harm,
   we may escalate to a human responder and encourage crisis services.</li>
<li>We store audit and safety logs in a controlled secure environment.
   Access is restricted to the founder and authorised safety review only.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data protection & GDPR</h2>
<p>
We operate under UK data protection rules (GDPR). You can request:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What we have stored about you</li>
<li>Correction of incorrect info</li>
<li>Deletion, unless we have to keep a record for serious safety reasons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third parties</h2>
<p>
We use infrastructure providers (for example hosting, payment processing,
and messaging platforms) to deliver the service. We choose providers that
respect privacy and allow us to meet our safety obligations.
</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>
We may update this page over time as we improve safety and clarity.
We will keep it human-readable and honest.
