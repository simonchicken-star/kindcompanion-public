<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<h2>Age</h2>
<p>
You must be 18+ to use KindCompanion. This service is built for adults.
</p>

<h2>Not emergency / not medical</h2>
<p>
KindCompanion is emotional support and coping guidance.
We are not a medical provider, crisis line, or emergency responder.
If you are in immediate danger or believe you might harm yourself or someone else:
call your local emergency services right now (in the UK call 999),
or contact Samaritans on 116 123 (free, 24/7).
</p>

<h2>How we respond</h2>
<p>
We try to offer grounding, reflection, practical next steps, and calm.
If we believe there is immediate risk to life or serious harm,
we may attempt to connect you to a human responder or crisis resource.
We do this to keep you safe.
</p>

<h2>Respect policy</h2>
<p>
No harassment, hate, or threats toward our team or toward other people.
We will disengage if you attempt to use this service to plan or threaten
harm to other people.
</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>
We offer low-cost support tiers (example: £1/week) and “priority human escalation”
tiers for people who want faster human attention. Payments are handled securely
through Stripe or similar payment processors. We do not store your full card data.
</p>

<h2>Data use</h2>
<p>
We may review messages to improve safety, quality, and response consistency.
We never sell your messages for ads. Ever.
</p>

<h2>Liability</h2>
<p>
This is a wellbeing assistant. We cannot guarantee outcomes.
You accept that you are responsible for your own decisions,
and you agree to seek emergency or clinical help if you need urgent care.
