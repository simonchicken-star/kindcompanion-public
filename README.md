“You are not a burden. You are allowed to be here.”

## What we do
KindCompanion is a 24/7 private emotional support line for adults (18+).

You can offload stress, money panic, burnout, loneliness, racing thoughts at 2am, or “I can’t do this anymore” without being judged and without alerting your boss.

We are *not* emergency care, not medical advice, not therapy, not HR.
If you are in immediate danger or believe you might harm yourself or someone else:
call your local emergency services (UK: 999),
or contact Samaritans on 116 123 (free, 24/7).

## Safety model
1. You talk to us first.
2. If we believe there is immediate risk to life or serious harm, we escalate to a human responder and strongly guide you to crisis services.
3. We log that escalation decision for duty-of-care.
4. We never sell your messages for ads. Ever.

See \privacy.html\ and \	erms.html\ in this repo. They’re written in plain English.

## Pricing experiments
- £1 / week — Starter Reassurance
- £4 / month — Daily Check-in & Coping
- £7 / week — Priority Human Escalation
- “Burnout Line” for employers — flat monthly fee so staff can vent safely without going through HR first
- One-off micro-packs (sleep panic / money panic) ~£0.99

Goal: affordable calm that doesn’t sell you out.

## Compliance posture
Public, in this repo:
- Our site (static HTML)
- Our Terms (18+, not clinical, escalation rules)
- Our Privacy (no ads, duty-of-care)
- Our crisis language

Private, not in this repo:
- Locked-down secure vault for keys and audit logs
- Uptime monitoring task that logs site availability to prove reliability
- Incident response + escalation runbook
- Data classification policy

We do this so we qualify for grants / wellbeing pilots without taking investment.
