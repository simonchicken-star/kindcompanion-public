“You are not a burden. You are allowed to be here.”

## What we do
KindCompanion is a 24/7 private emotional support line for adults (18+).

You can dump stress, money panic, work burnout, racing thoughts at 2am, or “I can’t do this anymore” without being judged or flagged to your boss.

We are *not* emergency care, not medical advice, not therapy, not HR.
If you are in immediate danger or believe you might harm yourself or someone else:
call your local emergency services (UK: 999),
or contact Samaritans on 116 123 (free, 24/7).

## Why we exist
- Most people don’t phone a crisis line until they’re already at the ledge.
- Workplaces say “reach out if you’re struggling” and then quietly performance-manage you out.
- Nights are the worst. 02:17 is the worst.

We sit in that gap: “I am not okay, but I don’t want to make it a whole incident.”

## Safety model
1. You talk to us first.
2. If we see possible immediate risk to life, we escalate to a human responder and strongly guide you to crisis services.
3. We log those decisions for audit and duty-of-care.
4. We never sell your messages for ads. Ever.

See privacy.html and 	erms.html in this repo. They are written in plain English.

## Pricing experiments
- £1 / week — Starter Reassurance
- £4 / month — Daily Check-in & Coping
- £7 / week — Priority Human Escalation
- “Burnout Line” for employers — flat monthly fee so staff can offload safely without going through HR first
- One-off micro-packs (sleep panic, money panic) ~£0.99

Goal: make calm affordable without selling your data.

## Governance / compliance posture
This repo intentionally shows:
- Our public site (static HTML)
- Our privacy promise
- Our terms (18+, non-clinical, escalation rules)
- Our crisis guidance text

Internally (not in this repo) we maintain:
- Secure key vault with locked NTFS ACL
- Audit log of uptime / availability via scheduled heartbeat
- Incident response runbook
- Data classification and escalation policy

This is how we make ourselves “grant-worthy” without taking VC.
